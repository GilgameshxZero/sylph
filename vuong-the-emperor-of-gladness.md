# The Emperor of Gladness

It is no secret, of course, that among the authors I’ve encountered, and especially those from whom I derive particular inspiration for my own voice, Vuong stands as one of my favorite, among the likes of Zimmer Bradley and Le Guin. I have yet to read his poetry; his premiere novel said enough to convince me. Necessarily, it is difficult to enunciate specifics about voice, but I attempt to do so here. What strikes me is some combination of the thoughtfulness of each sentence, with a natural rhythm, the variation in structure, and length, so that each passage flows like lines of poetry through a forest of particularly detailed observations. Coming from a scientist, I find this latter technique difficult to emulate; for me, the world is pure and structured, controlled and ordered in ways that fit together with innate reason to be. But for Vuong, I suspect, it is enough to have this chaos. It is enough to just notice, to just listen, and not derive any further insights beyond that. It is enough, I must tell myself, to simply observe, and let the world pass me by, so that I may learn its true nature, without the desire, any desire, to change it. This, I believe, is what plagues me, and what plagues many of those in science.

While rhythm and flow are no easy feat, I find them the more technical of the skills used in writing. It is a mastery of the language and the evocation of words which enables this poetry. All this to say that I deeply respect Vuong’s nature of observation. When he writes, “as you approach, you’ll be flanked by wide stretches of thumb-sized buds shooting lucent through April mud,” I read a long breath following the previous sentence’s short. I take in all, so much, of this context, to only notice so little: that buds litter the spring grounds. And I observe this, of Vuong’s observation: it is not that he is incapable of deriving intuition and insight. It is a deliberate demonstration of restraint, saying *I can stop anywhere, anytime I want. I choose to stop here.*

As I read *The Emperor of Gladness*, I am reminded that beyond the substance of a passage, the construction of a passage has the power to reshape my own thought process. In this way, we become who we read, and we become what we write. In the way that I pursue my truth, then, surely, I must be capable of emulating the ones I respect.

So I leave this preface with a quote from *the* preface:

> Your worm is your only emperor…
> We fat all creatures else to fat us
> and we fat ourselves for maggots.

The problem is that it’s so fucking hopeless. The whole first two sections is so devoid of any hope, any respite, any future. In every corner, all I see is the inevitable—it is as Chiang would have written in those time-twisting short stories of his: that we walk only toward our inevitable doom, that we know where we must go, and need only figure out a way to get there.

If we think like what we read, then I’m depressed.
