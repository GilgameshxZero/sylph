> “failing ninth-grade algebra is the reason many students are left back in ninth grade, which in turn is the greatest risk factor for dropping out.”

This is among the hardest reads I’ve encountered—not due to any particular literary quality—but rather, for its bluntness in describing the human condition, or more accurately, my own condition. I see in DeBoer’s writing my own choices, many reasonable, some not so much, laid out, along with their proposed reason. Unfortunately, he is rarely wrong, and I concede that I am no special case in this machine. Or, rather, if I am, I need a better case. I need a better reason. I need proof; that I am special. And now, he’s taken most of that away.

But with these hypothesis, these suppositions, there is always a black swan amidst the crowd. If I could only identify where he was wrong.

> The basic failing of our society lies in our dogged belief that we as human beings should only get what we deserve, rather than what we need. […] We will continue to embrace this idea because doing so enriches the already enriched, because it suits the interests of the powerful, because it is the justification of a system that causes vast suffering and then tells people it’s their own fault.
