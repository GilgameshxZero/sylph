# Ready Player One

Isn’t it quite unrealistic that a few minutes on an exercise bike can power a small electric heater? Even if he was generating 400W, which is fairly difficult, that would only power the heater for as long as he was on the bike. I suppose a few minutes couldn’t hurt, but really, I’d rather save that power for something a bit more deserving. A lot of computing can be done with just 10W.

That said, the thing reads like fanfiction at times. Sentences are clunky, repetitive. It feels like the author wanted, needed, to get something out, to move something along, and took the shortest route to get there. No, no… writing should be a joyride, a walk, an enjoyment. Maybe that’s my primary complaint here. I didn’t feel this way with Cixin Liu’s translated books, but perhaps the clunkiness there is endearing. Maybe there’s an attempt to try to write things from the perspective of the character.

Okay, I finished the novel.

It’s just clunky, uninspired writing that gets from A to B without any regard for *noticing*. It’s like if a third-person perspective was forced into a first-person sentence. You can argue that Wade’s a kid, and kids see the world in a simpler way. But he barely sees the world in this writing. Kids see and feel much the same things as adults, they just don’t know how to properly process those feelings. This is the writing of a retarded kid, and Wade’s not retarded.

Maybe this is me being too postmodern. Maybe this is me being hypercritical of the voice, where the novel focuses on the plot. But plot can be written by anyone, and it’s worthwhile to pay some attention to *how* something is written, not just *what* happens.

Stop and think. Smell the flowers. Writing is the furthest thing from a straight trip from A to B. Notice the surroundings a bit, please.
