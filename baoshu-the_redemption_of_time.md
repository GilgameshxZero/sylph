# The Redemption of Time

December 11, 2025

Part I, really, is largely wish fulfillment—though, admittedly, it did fulfill my wish. I’m reminded of my own dreams, the people I had met in them, and inevitably lost, their only shadow being what remained of their inspiration of my own actions. We are judged not on our birth, not on our family, not on our wealth, but on our actions. To that end, there is always opportunity to do more.

The second and third parts impressed me less. The goals of an entity with power to rival the universe must necessarily be incomprehensible. That two humans were chosen to carry these wishes scares me. How far must have this entity have fallen to rely on the minds of humans?

There are forces out there beyond our possible conception. It is no tragedy to devote one’s life to romance. Why must our struggle be greater than even us? It’s folly to forget one’s limits.
